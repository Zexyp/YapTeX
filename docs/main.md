When using directives then the `#` symbol must be the first symbol of the line. If you want to start your line with a `#`, you will have to escape it by using a backslash (eg. `\#`).

- Files
    - `bn`: filepath basename
    - `dn`: filepath dirname
- Special
    - `html`: html escape given value
    - `id`: convert to id
    - `esc`: escape special characters (eg. `"`)

#set _HELLO "C:/Users/faFa/je \"cYp\"?.txt"

```
l%HELLO -> l%_HELLO
u%HELLO -> u%_HELLO
t%HELLO -> t%_HELLO

bn%HELLO -> bn%_HELLO
